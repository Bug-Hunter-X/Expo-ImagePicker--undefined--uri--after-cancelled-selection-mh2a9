This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library. The issue arises when attempting to access the `uri` property of the selected image after the user has canceled the image selection process.  In this scenario, the `uri` property will be undefined, leading to an error if your code doesn't handle this case gracefully.  For example, if you are trying to display the image immediately after selection, without any error handling, you'll encounter an error similar to this: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'uri')`
